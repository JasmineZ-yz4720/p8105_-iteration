# My first function

### Z score function
Z scores subtract the mean and divide by the sd.

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 0.3)
#compute z score for x_vec
(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)
```

```{r}
z_score = function(x){
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("Argument should be numbers")
  }else if(length(x)<2){
    stop("You need at least 2 numbers to get z scores")
  }
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x)
  z
}
```

```{r}
z_score(x = x_vec)
z_score(x = rnorm(10, mean = 5))
#z_score(x=3) now send the error message
#z_score(c("my", "name")) doesn't work on character vector
#z_score(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))
```
